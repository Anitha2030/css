"Make"
"To Do: Use any two of your existing 'if else' and or 'if,elif and else' programs"
#1. Create/modify existing program using the Tenary Operators syntax
a,b = 2,14
print(a) if a <= b else print(b)

#2. From your investigation and implementation of Tenary Operators program explain:
# Tenary Operator -- all code in one line code
# -(a) any use case for using or not using Tenary Operators

#  only true or false condition
# itâ€™s a compact alternative to the common multiline if-else control flow statements in situations when we only need to "switch" between two values.

# -(b) any limitiation(s) for using or not Tenary Operators

# Ternary Operators can be used to replace the if-else statement, it is only limited to usage for a single if-else statement.
# For multiple if-else statements, the Ternary Operators are not used.
