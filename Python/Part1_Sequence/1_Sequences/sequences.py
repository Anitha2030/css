# To DO:
print(2 * 2)   # Predict then Run, and Investigate
print()   # Modify to use a different operator
print()   # Modify to use a different operator
print()  # Make : Use a different number and/or operator

#What is variable in python? --Variables are containers for storing data values.
# Variables are names given to data items that may take on one or more values during a program’s runtime.
# Following are the variable naming conventions in python:
# It cannot begin with a number.
# It must be a single word.
# It must consist of letters and _ symbols only.
# Variables in Python which start with _ (underscore) are considered as “Unuseful”.


#Modify your program to use variables instead of hard coded values
