//Task 1 - Create a variable that stores your name and log a string to the console that greets you using template literals.
let name = "Anitha Natarajan"
console.log(`Good Luck ${name}`)

//Task 2 -  Create Variables storing your name, your age and your favourite film or tv series. Using template literals I want you to log a sentence including these values to the console.

let movie="Watcher"
console.log(`I am ${name} ${age}.I enjoy watching the movie ${movie} `)

//Task 3 - Create variables storing what you ate for breakfast, lunch and dinner yesterday and log it to the console. Without changing the initial variables I want you update these variables and log them to the console.

let yesterdayBreakfast="Bread"
let yesterdayLunch="Chicken"
let yesterdayDinner="Soup"
console.log(`Yesterday's  Breakfast : ${yesterdayBreakfast}`)
console.log(`Yesterday's Lunch      : ${yesterdayLunch}`)
console.log(`Yesterday's  Dinner    : ${yesterdayDinner}`)

yesterdayBreakfast="Pancake"

console.log(`Today's Lunch     : ${yesterdayLunch}`)
console.log(`Today's  Dinner   : ${yesterdayDinner}`)

//If you manage to complete the challenges, I would like you to research String Methods and the Math Library. Putting together some working examples.

//Math.random
console.log(Math.random())

//strings
console.log("Good luck all for this Bootcamp Course")

//rounding down to whole numbers
let x=3
console.log(Math.floor (x*5))

//.round up to whole number
console.log(Math.ceil(Math.random()*5))

//round the numbers up or down to whole numbers
console.log(Math.round(x+1.6))

//count the length of the string
console.log("Anitha Natarajan".length)
